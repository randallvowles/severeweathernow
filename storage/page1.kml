Runoff will increase\nwater levels in area holding ponds and drainage ditches,\nreducing storage capacity to absorb future rainfall.\n- Isolated flooding in low lying areas will make driving\ndifficult. Ponding of water in low lying areas may result\nin brief road closures.\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is unfavorable for tornadoes\n- CURRENT THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: None\n- The tornado threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- Emergency considerations need not include a threat for\ntornadoes. Showers and thunderstorms with strong gusty\nwinds may still occur.\n- Little to no preparations needed to guard against tropical\ntornadoes.\n- Ensure readiness for the next tropical tornado event.\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Little to None\n- Little to no potential impacts from tornadoes.\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- Local Weather Conditions and Forecasts: NWS Tallahassee\n- http://www.weather.gov/tallahassee'), (u'instruction', None), (u'parameter', [OrderedDict([(u'valueName', u'WMOHEADER'), (u'value', None)]), OrderedDict([(u'valueName', u'UGC'), (u'value', u'FLZ019')]), OrderedDict([(u'valueName', u'VTEC'), (u'value', u'/O.CON.KTAE.TR.W.1011.000000T0000Z-000000T0000Z/')]), OrderedDict([(u'valueName', u'TIME...MOT...LOC'), (u'value', None)])]), (u'area', OrderedDict([(u'areaDesc', u'Madison'), (u'polygon', None), (u'geocode', [OrderedDict([(u'valueName', u'FIPS6'), (u'value', u'012079')]), OrderedDict([(u'valueName', u'UGC'), (u'value', u'FLZ019')])])]))]))]))])
